       The Xbox Wireless Controller is the primary game controller for the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S home video game consoles, also commercialized for its use in Windows-based PCs, and compatible with other operating systems such as macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. The controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360 controller, but with various tweaks to its design, such as a revised shape, redesigned analog sticks, shoulder buttons, and triggers, along with new rumble motors within the triggers to allow for directional haptic feedback.

    <article>
      <p>
       An Xbox Wireless Controller purchased in or after June 2015 can take updates wirelessly without connecting with a USB cable. This controller has a small, circular 3.5-mm port on the bottom of the controller (controllers without this port must update via USB cable).
      </p>

          <li>You only need to update your controller one time to use the stereo headset adapter.
